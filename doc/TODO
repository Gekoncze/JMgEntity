tests
    move explorer and explorer gui tests from another project

    remove deprecated test classes
        replace deprecated test classes with new classes

    add more unit tests
        transaction
        transaction manager
        all explorer services
        all explorer gui services

validator
    add "entity as a whole" validator
        run before or after field validations?
        or allow both?

    add entity class (entity definition itself) validator

explorer
    add / remove row buttons are missing

    customizations
        add field select display order customizations
        add field select display customization

    add list field and list view
        implement list view
        add mouse click selection to UiList
        add multi selection to UiList

    add cleanup button
        will offer to delete objects that are not owned
        add button to main menu
        change icon of remove - unify delete and clear

    bug in ui list field
        clicking on icon does not select field
        check if this should be handled somehow in ui value field

    improve multi select
        add drag and drop move action
        add keyboard shortcuts to move up / down
        add keyboard shortcuts to select next / previous item

    navigation
        add menu items for right click in navigation tree
        add navigation bar
        add button to locate currently opened object in navigation tree

    idea for mouse event traversal (check if this doesn't work in swing by default)
        investigate if this should be implemented
        for each ui component, register a mouse listener
        the handler will iterate to top most parent
        then it will propagate an onEnter event down to the target component
        then it will propagate an onLeave event up to the top most parent component
        consume should stop the propagation

    add validations
        add validation on navigation refresh + display error icon
        add validation on component refresh + highlight errorneous fields + add tooltip
        run validations for all entities before export or compile
